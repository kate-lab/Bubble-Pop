# Bubble Pop game
This game (loosely based on the classic Space Invaders) is a bubble popping game built using Javascript, HTML and CSS. It was my first full build project during the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** Javascript, CSS, HTML

  
## Features

- optimised for mobile and web using media queries

- human-readable code to ensure reusability
- aesthetically pleasing and functional UX
- enemies and characters designed by me!

- character selector menu - chosen character is playable in-game
- count down to play with a set timeout
- use of keyboard event listeners OR on-screen button clicks to move character and shoot
- score accumulator and lives decrementer
- collision detector to add score (if on enemy) or remove lives (if on character)

  
## Planning Process

First of all I wireframed out my project, looking at all of the HTML I would need for both a start page with character selecter and the game grid.

I then put together an overview of how I might develop the core features of this game using javascript. Some of these methods were used in the final game, but some of these features I modified or found alternative and better solutions for. Some of the "would like" features took a back seat to the minimum viable product, but are TBC as I continue working on the game!

As well as using this plan for my game, I also mapped out some of the core algorithms and functionality using pen and paper. Here is a snippet of my though process mapping for the enemy movement part of my code.
